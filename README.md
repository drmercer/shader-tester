ShaderTester
============

ShaderTester (WIP) will be a Java program that allows OpenGL developers (particularly Android developers) to test run their GLSL shaders line-by-line. Often times it is difficult to debug GLSL shaders because (unlike Java or other CPU languages) one cannot output variables from a shader to a debug log or something similar (i.e. System.out).
